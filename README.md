# 🛒 SuperMarket Management System

A Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)-oriented supermarket management desktop application built using C# and Windows Forms. This project was created as part of our academic coursework to practically demonstrate the performance and time complexity of various sorting algorithms and data structures in a real-world use case.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

- ✅ Visualize and compare sorting algorithms through real data
- ✅ Demonstrate how different data structures affect performance
- ✅ Offer a working CRUD-based management system for users and items

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered

- 🔢 Sorting Algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

- 🧱 Data Structures:
  - Dynamic Array
  - Linked List
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)

- ⏱️ Time Complexity Evaluation:
  - Execution time is displayed after each sort
  - Helps understand real-time impact of algorithms and structures

## 🖥️ Application Modules

### 1. 👥 User Management
- Add, Edit, Delete users
- Sort users by **Name** or **NIC**
- Select sorting algorithm and data structure
- View sorting time in milliseconds

### 2. 📦 Item Management
- Add, Edit, Delete items (e.g., food, medicine, drinks)
- Includes fields like Item Code, Gross Amount, Net Amount, Expiry/Manufacture Dates
- Select data structure for item storage
- Demonstrate data structure access time
